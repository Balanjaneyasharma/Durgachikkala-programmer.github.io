        <p>The number of devices and coverage about digital technologies has been rising, hence the threat by cyber-attacks on such devices. Cyber attacks can take many forms, from phishing to identity theft, and the need to guard the greater user coverage of the internet is greater than ever.

            Simple antivirus software is no longer sufficient if you want to save yourself from cyber attacks. The development of better, more sophisticated technologies to guard against cyber threats is the subject of multiple academia and industry projects worldwide.</p><br>

            <p>Companies are involved not just in making new commercial technologies to protect individual domestic consumers against cyber attacks. Some of the most frequent cyber-attacks are government data repositories or the storage facilities of large companies. Nearly all large companies need a way to protect their data and their employees’ data and associated firms.

                Jobs in cybersecurity have been growing at thrice the pace as other tech jobs, primarily due to the reasons mentioned above. Not only are these jobs incredibly well-paying, but they are also some of the most critical positions in any firm. The 5G market in India is estimated to reach INR 19 Billion by 2025 so this new technology in 2021 can be a game-changer.
                
                Especially in domains such as e-commerce and retail, the importance of cybersecurity cannot be underscored. Thousands of customers store their personal and financial data on retail companies’ websites to allow for easy payments. They also have accounts and passwords, which need to be protected. Similarly, in the healthcare industry, patient data needs to be protected against cyber threats.</p>
